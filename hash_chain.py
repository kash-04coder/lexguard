"""
Hash-chain integrity ledger.

This is what turns "we hash files" into "we can prove the entire history
of a document is untampered" -- the actual Blockchain & Cybersecurity
differentiator for the hackathon.

Design (deliberately simple -- this is a *ledger*, not a consensus
network; we don't need mining, peers, or a token, we need tamper-evidence):

Each document has its own hash chain. Every meaningful event on that
document (created, new version uploaded, verified, shared, signed,
permission changed) appends one block. A block commits to:

    chain_hash = SHA256(previous_hash + content_hash + action + actor + timestamp + document_id)

Because each block's hash depends on the previous block's hash, changing
or deleting *any* historical block changes that block's own chain_hash,
which no longer matches what the next block committed to as its
"previous_hash" -- so verify_chain() can walk the whole history and
pinpoint exactly where (and therefore prove nothing after it can be
trusted) tampering occurred. This is the same core idea as a blockchain's
tamper-evidence, scoped to a single document's audit trail instead of a
distributed ledger.

Genesis block: previous_hash = "0" * 64 (64 zeros, same width as a
SHA-256 hex digest), same convention as Bitcoin's genesis block.
